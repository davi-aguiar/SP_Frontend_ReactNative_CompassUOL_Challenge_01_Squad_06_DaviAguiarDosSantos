# Primeiro Desafio da Trilha de React Native

## Objective

The challenge aims to create a post page, where clicking on a post from the homepage will redirect the user to a second page for the corresponding post.

## Requirements

The code must include the following requirements:
Initial Screen with List of Posts:

Create an initial screen with a list of posts.
The list of posts should adapt to different screen sizes.
Posts should be obtained from a data source, such as the JSONPlaceholder API or a simulated source.
Navigation to the Post Page:

When clicking on a post on the initial screen, the user should be taken to a second screen.
In this second screen, the selected post should be displayed.
Below the post, there should be a list with the respective comments related to that post.
Data Source:

Use a fictitious API, such as JSONPlaceholder or DummyJSON, to retrieve data for posts and comments. If preferred, you can also use mocks or a static file with the information.
Use TypeScript:

Develop the project using TypeScript to add typing and code security.
Extra Details:
